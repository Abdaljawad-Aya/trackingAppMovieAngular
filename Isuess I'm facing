development mode won't work 
- not displaying the console.log message even thought i enable it the prod mode.



** note

npm start

This executes an arbitrary command specified in its "scripts" object's "start" property of the package. If the "scripts" object does not specify a "start" property, it will run server.js node.

ng serve

Use webpack-dev-server to create, monitor, and serve the application from local memory. When you're prepared for deployment
